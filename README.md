I genuinely have no idea what I'm doing.. If you cant tell by my name I'm genuinly asking for help. This is inappropriate are in the wrong place or just too much of a noob question I apologize please delete. I'm trying to figure out how to use web chat GTP do use the one word commands and it keeps bringing me to the page where it says I can download on my desktop. I click
it but I don't see any changes I feel like an idiot typing on here like its a forum when I know it's not but, worth a shot if someone might help.
